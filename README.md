# Language-Vocabulary-Manager
Python application to save and manage vocabulary of a language that you learned   
        
There is an interactive interface with 6 options: add word, exam, see stats, see words learned, reset and exit.        
      
1. add word: As the name suggests, this option adds a new word to you vocabulary (WORDS.txt), in your primary and secondary languages.    
         
2. exam: Generate an exam with a chosen number of random questions about words in your vocabulary.

3. see stats: Show your languages, how many questions you have done on exams, how many correct and wrong answers you got, and your total number of words

4. see words learned: Show all the words you have learned so far.

5. reset: Delete your stats info and your vocabulary, and generates a new empty one.

6. exit: Stop the code.
